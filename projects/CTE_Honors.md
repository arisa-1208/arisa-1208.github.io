  The <b>Noelani Craft & Children’s Fair</b> is an annual fundraiser supporting school programs, faculty, 
  and facility improvements. My team and I developed a <b>comprehensive marketing plan</b> to boost vendor 
  participation by <b>at least 10%</b>, increase event awareness, and optimize engagement through 
  data-driven strategies.
</p>
<p>
    Our strategy focused on <b>vendor engagement, targeted promotions, and pricing adjustments</b> to attract more 
    participants. We conducted surveys and analyzed data to ensure maximum efficiency in our outreach efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The results showed a <b>66.7% vendor return interest</b>, proving the effectiveness of our approach. 
    Future recommendations include improving vendor support, enhancing social media campaigns, and offering 
    early-bird incentives.
