## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Noelani Craft & Children’s Fair** is an annual fundraising event that supports school programs, including **music, PE, enrichment activities, technology, and facility improvements**. This event relies heavily on vendor participation to generate revenue, but in previous years, vendor engagement was inconsistent due to factors such as **high participation fees, lack of targeted outreach, and competition from other local events**.  

This project aimed to **increase vendor participation by at least 10%** for the next fair by implementing **strategic marketing techniques and cost reduction measures**. The two primary focus areas were:  
1. **Reducing vendor fees** by at least 20% to encourage more small businesses and first-time vendors to participate.  
2. **Leveraging social media marketing (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube)** to enhance visibility and attract both vendors and attendees.  

By executing these initiatives, we aimed to **maximize fundraising potential, improve vendor retention, and increase overall community engagement**.

## 💡 **SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)**  

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |  
|--------------|---------------|  
| Open to all vendors | Limited vendor support (e.g., no free lunch) |  
| Strong community engagement | Vendor audience limited to children & families |  

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |  
|-----------------|-----------|  
| Social media marketing can expand reach | Vendors have alternative events |  
| More vendors = greater fundraising | COVID-19 affected vendor availability |  

The SWOT analysis highlighted key areas for improvement. The event’s **strong community engagement** was a major strength, but the **limited financial support for vendors and competition from other events** posed challenges. This informed our approach to marketing and vendor outreach.
