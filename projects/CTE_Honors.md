## Project Overview  
The Noelani Craft & Children’s Fair is an annual fundraising event that supports school programs, including music, PE, enrichment activities, technology, and facility improvements. The event relies heavily on vendor participation to generate revenue, but in previous years, vendor engagement was inconsistent due to factors such as high participation fees, lack of targeted outreach, and competition from other local events.  

This project aimed to increase vendor participation by at least 10% for the next fair by implementing strategic marketing techniques and cost reduction measures. The primary strategies focused on two key areas: reducing vendor fees and leveraging social media marketing. By lowering vendor fees by at least 20%, we sought to remove financial barriers and encourage greater participation from small businesses and first-time vendors. Additionally, we focused on utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to enhance visibility and attract a larger audience of vendors and attendees.  

By executing these initiatives, the goal was to maximize vendor turnout, increase fundraising potential, and enhance overall community engagement. The success of the project was measured through vendor surveys, attendance numbers, and engagement metrics from our digital marketing efforts.

## Data & Market Research  

To better understand the challenges affecting vendor participation, we conducted vendor surveys and analyzed past event data. The survey responses provided insight into factors such as pricing concerns, promotional effectiveness, and vendor expectations for participation.  

### Vendor Attendance Insights

Survey results showed that only 40.9% of vendors who responded had attended the fair before. Many vendors expressed concerns about pricing, with some citing that participation fees were too high for small businesses. In addition, vendors were looking for more targeted promotional efforts to increase customer turnout.  

### Impact of Vendor Fees on Participation

One of the most significant findings was the impact of vendor fees on participation rates. The pricing analysis showed that reducing vendor fees by at least 20% would significantly increase participation. Some vendors had to pay as much as $500 to attend similar events, while others only paid around $90. The discrepancy in fees made it clear that a more flexible pricing model could make participation more accessible and attract a more diverse range of vendors.  

Our analysis also showed that many vendors were interested in digital outreach efforts to drive customer traffic. Informative digital posters and promotional videos were identified as more effective than traditional flyers, as they reached a larger audience and engaged potential attendees more effectively.

## SWOT Analysis  

| Strengths | Weaknesses |  
|-----------|-----------|  
| Open to all vendors | Limited vendor support (e.g., no free lunch) |  
| Strong community engagement | Vendor audience limited to children & families |  

| Opportunities | Threats |  
|-------------|---------|  
| Social media marketing can expand reach | Vendors have alternative events |  
| More vendors = greater fundraising | COVID-19 affected vendor availability |  

The SWOT analysis provided further clarity on the event's strengths and areas for improvement. While the strong community engagement and open vendor policy were key advantages, the limited financial support for vendors and competition from other events were notable challenges. These findings helped shape the final recommendations for vendor engagement and marketing strategies.

## My Role & Contributions  

I played a key role in leading the market research and vendor analysis to identify the main challenges preventing vendor participation. My responsibilities included designing and distributing vendor surveys, analyzing participation trends, and developing strategies to address vendor concerns. Based on the survey findings, I proposed a pricing model that reduced financial barriers while ensuring the event remained profitable.  

I also contributed to the development of the event's digital marketing strategy. This involved creating and implementing a social media campaign to attract vendors and increase overall awareness of the fair. I designed digital advertisements, created content tailored for different social media platforms, and worked on a plan to track engagement metrics to measure the effectiveness of the campaign.  

Additionally, I participated in the evaluation phase of the project. This involved analyzing post-event survey responses and comparing vendor turnout to previous years to assess the success of our initiatives. Through this process, I helped identify areas for future improvement, including optimizing vendor communication and refining digital marketing efforts.

## Lessons Learned & Skills Gained  

This project provided me with valuable insights into marketing strategy, consumer behavior, and event planning. I learned how to conduct and analyze surveys, extract meaningful trends, and use data to drive decision-making. The experience also helped me refine my skills in strategic communication, as I had to present our findings and recommendations in a way that was persuasive and actionable.  

Beyond data analysis, this project strengthened my understanding of social media marketing and digital outreach techniques. I gained hands-on experience in designing promotional materials, creating engaging online content, and utilizing analytics to measure the impact of advertising efforts. The ability to track social media performance and adjust strategies based on engagement metrics was an important skill I developed through this experience.  

Additionally, this project improved my collaboration and leadership skills. Working with event organizers, vendors, and school representatives required me to balance different perspectives and align marketing strategies with the needs of multiple stakeholders. Learning to adapt strategies based on real-world feedback was a crucial takeaway from this project.
