## Overview

**Problem:**
College students often struggle to balance academic responsibilities, part-time work, extracurricular activities, and personal life. While tools like **Google Calendar** provide general scheduling platforms, they lack personalized features that cater to individual academic goals and preferences. Other platforms, such as **Notion**, require extensive customization, making them difficult for new users to adopt effectively. Many students aren’t sure how to allocate their study hours efficiently, especially when juggling multiple courses with varying workloads.

**Solution:**  
*Sync’d* addresses this issue by offering a web application that generates **optimized weekly schedules** based on student inputs and academic goals. By integrating an **AI-powered recommendation system**, it helps students plan their weeks intelligently while adapting to evolving responsibilities. Sync’d reduces last-minute cramming, prevents burnout, and promotes better time management through **personalized study suggestions**.

## Approach

*Sync’d* will provide students with a streamlined and intelligent scheduling system. Users will be able to:

- Log in and create a personalized profile.  
- Input class times, work schedules, club meetings, and other fixed commitments.  
- Define academic goals (e.g., *study ICS 212 for 5 hours/week*).  
- Set preferences (e.g., *avoid early mornings*, *keep Fridays free*).  
- Receive a personalized weekly schedule generated using an AI-powered recommendation engine.
- View, modify, and save suggested schedules.  
- Allow the system to adapt recommendations based on user feedback, including skipped or completed study sessions.

## AI Integration

*Sync’d* will leverage AI to deliver smarter, more personalized planning—turning **static schedules into dynamic, adaptive tools**.

#####  » Smart Schedule Generator  
Using a simple AI model or leveraging the OpenAI GPT API, the system will analyze user inputs and generate an optimized weekly schedule. By considering fixed commitments, academic priorities, and personal preferences, the AI will ensure students receive well-balanced schedules that optimize their time while preventing overload.

#####  » Adaptive Learning (Optional)  
Over time, Sync’d can track behavior patterns. If a student frequently skips scheduled study sessions at certain times, the AI will learn from this pattern and adjust future recommendations accordingly. For instance, if a student consistently avoids evening study sessions, the AI will deprioritize those time slots when generating future schedules.

Several use cases illustrate the benefits of Sync’d:

- A new student logs in, sets up a profile, enters class and work hours, and sets study goals. The AI generates an optimized schedule based on this information.
- A student logs in and modifies their schedule to avoid weekend study sessions. The AI updates its suggestions accordingly.
- A student checks their dashboard to review the upcoming week and receives alerts for daily tasks.
- The system learns from user behavior, noticing that early morning study sessions are frequently skipped. Future recommendations adjust to avoid those times.
- A student's finalized schedules are exported to Google Calendar or downloaded as PDFs for easy reference.
